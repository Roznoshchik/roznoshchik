### Hi there I'm RR ðŸ‘‹
[![RR's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=roznoshchik)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

I work in Javascript and Python. I use Flask/Django, or Koa / Express / NestJS on the backend. I work with SQL using SQLAlchemy, Sequelize, Miro-ORM, Prisma and Mongodb using Mongoose. On the frontend, I work with Angular, React, jQuery, Vanilla JS, and SCSS.

I am passionate about building things from the ground up and love constantly learning new things. I prefer working with mission driven organizations that are actively working to improve life for planet and people. 

In my spare time I am addicted to playing beach volleyball, sleep, and coding interesting side projects. In a past life I was a Product Manager, Researcher, and Illustrator.
